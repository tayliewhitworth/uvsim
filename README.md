UVSIM - A Simple Machine Language Simulator
---------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
----------------
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed Python 3.10 or later.
- You have a basic understanding of command-line interfaces.
- The files that you are testing are in the same directory as uvsim.py

Usage:
------
1. Open your command-line interface (CLI).

2. Navigate to the directory where the UVSim program is located.

3. Type the following command to start the UVSim program:
    python uvsim.py - it is case sensitive.

4. After launching the program, you will be asked to enter the name of a BasicML program file:
    "Enter the name of the BasicML program file: " (example: 'program.txt' or 'Test1.txt') and press Enter - make sure that the BasicML program file is in the same directory as uvsim.py and you include .txt at the end. If not, make sure you know the location of the file and enter it correctly (example: '../Test2.txt')

5. The program will load and execute the BasicML program. 
    - If the program includes READ instructions, you will be prompted to enter a number. 
    - If the program includes WRITE instructions, it will print a number to the console.

6. The program will continue executing the BasicML instructions until it encounters a HALT instruction or until it runs out of instructions.

7. When the program execution is completed, the following message will be printed:
    "Program Halted"

8. The program will then end.
